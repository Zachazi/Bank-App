Bank-App Overview 

This Bank-App project is a collaborative, Streamlit-based Python application designed to simulate basic bank operations via a user-friendly interface. To run this code you will need to create an environment for the code and install streamlit in the environment, we weren't able to push the environment we used because the file was too big and we couldn't figure out an alternative. 
Once you have installed stremlit in your environment run "streamlit run Home.py" in your python terminal and your code will run.
